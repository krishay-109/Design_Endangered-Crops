        <p>
            There are several reasons to protect the ebony tree, Diospyros spp. First, the ebony is demanded due to its dense, dark hardwood; very valued for furniture making and production of musical instruments and ornamental pieces. This economic value supports many livelihoods based on sustainable harvesting. Further, ebony trees play a key ecological role in providing habitats as well as sources of food to various species of wildlife supporting biodiversity. More than that, they are linked with peculiar forest ecosystems and play an important role in maintaining soil health and preventing soil erosion. In any case, there have been significant declines in ebony populations due to massive over-harvesting and habitat destruction. Then, protection of the ebony tree can help advocate sustainable forestry practices while conserving biodiversity, providing incentives for future generations to enjoy their ecological and economic values.

        <h2>Endangerment Reasons</h2>

        
        <p>
            The ebony tree is threatened to extinction for some major reasons. Firstly, it is greatly threatened by over-exploitation for its pricey, heavy hardwood. With the demand for ebony wood in furniture and musical instruments increasing so rapidly, this has consequently brought about massive declines in population. Habitat loss, again, resulting from deforestation for agriculture, logging, and urbanization, has decimated the natural environments in which ebony trees thrive drastically. This is further diminished by the wild population through illegal logging by poaching the species for valuable timber products. The slow growth rate and extended maturity period of the tree do not help to improve the situation; it is not easy to recover from several plantations. Climate change will also change the habitat and conditions, which are required for the survival of the ebony trees. These factors put together make ebony trees fall under an uncertain situation, having placed a great urgency on measures towards conservation.
